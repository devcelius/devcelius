### Hi there 👋

My name's devcelius and I'm a programmer with over 6 years spent making great projects.

I'm working on growing my already wide skillset, as I'm a primary full-stack web developer, who is branching into machine learning and neural networks.

Here's a general idea of who I am and what I'm doing:

- ✍️ I've worked on various python and javascript applications, mostly web apps and RAGs
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding the architecture of LLMs and deep learning.
- 🌱 Overall, enjoying programming and the logic behind it :)
- 📫 You can mail me [here](mailto:discodiscostuck@gmail.com) if you're looking to collaborate.

### 👋 That's it! This will grow, but for now, thanks for taking the time to read this!
