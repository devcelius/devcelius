### Hi there 👋

My name's devcelius and I'm a programmer with over 6 years spent making great projects.

I'm working on growing my already wide skillset, as I'm a primary full-stack web developer, who is branching into machine learning and neural networks.

Here's a general idea of who I am and what I'm doing:

- ✍️ I've worked on various python and javascript applications, branching from e-commerce and innovative web products to virtual RAGs with voice capabilities
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding the principles of neural networks, various functions and networks.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding the deep concepts of neural nets and various parts, such as ReLU.
- 📫 You can mail me [here](mailto:discodiscostuck@gmail.com) if you're looking to collaborate.

### 👋 That's it! This will grow, but for now, thanks for taking the time to read this!
